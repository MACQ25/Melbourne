This is Melbourne, a SpaCy and RegEx based Python bot that is primarily deployed in Discord!

The base of Melbourne uses regular expressions gotten from a JSON file in order to answer user questions
or explain that it cannot respond if it is something beyond its knowledge domain.

Currently Melbourne can only answer D&D based questions as it is the knowledge domain of choice, however the
data contained within the JSON can be changed in order to make it knowledgeable of other topics
