  10 = There are many celebrities that have mentioned having played D&D in the past, but perhaps the closest thing that D&D has to a "Celebrity" is voice actor Mathew Mercer, a very popular voice actor both for movies and video games that has his own D&D based show on youtube (named Critical Role) and now has a show based upon in on Amazon prime Video
  11 = You can choose feats, which are special talents your character has which can vary from mastery using heavy weapons to just being extremely lucky, you can choose your character's proficiencies with tools, weapons, languages and things that go unmentioned by the rules (so long as the DM allows it) and if you are a spell caster you can choose your spells, anything from invisibility to throwing fireballs.
  12 = TTRPG's, short for TableTop Role-Playing Games (or tabletop RPG's), are social games played with a group of friends around the table or online, where each participant creates, controls, and plays a fictional character in an evolving story or adventure. In most TTRPG's, one participant acts as the "game master", the host, referee, and facilitator of the game.
