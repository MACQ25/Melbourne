/** This command should be uniform and help the user understand Mel's complete functionality **/

I am a bot with knowledge on a specific topic, that being D&D (because I am a nerd), you may ask me to provide information on what the game itself is, how it is played, the various classes and races and some resources for you to know more about the game :D

You may:
- Ask how D&D is played 
- Ask about the classes
- Command me to throw some dice
- Tell me to give you external links
- Request me to stop or change the subject

Your welcome, have a nice day!
Glad to be of service {user}
